* A folder or route must have page file otherwise if user try to hit the route 404 Error will be displayed.
* Route grouping is a way of grouping a similar routes into a single folder later we can have similar layout 
to each route.

* Nextjs has two types of rendering
1. static rendering :- pages are chached only executs single time and later if user request same page.
 it will be returned from cache.
2. dynamic rendering :- Inside pages if we are dealing with apis using fetch() or something nextjs will know 
that this pages neeeds
to render dynamically every single time.

* Even though route changes layout never rerenders.
* Templates are same as layout but the only difference between them is template do rerender 

* Client side rendering :- user made request server sends back
html, css, js and user's machine executes all js and html gets hydrated

* Server side side rendering :- user made request, initial rendering of 
page occur at server and sent to user and at backside js is executing
which will automatically take the control over page.(initial 
render on server and execution on user's machine)

* React server component :- execution on component happens on server
 
* we can use client component inside serve component and 
vice versa but the only caveat is we can't pass non serializable
props 

* functions, dates, recursive things can't be serialized

* ORM :- ORM frameworks provide a way to interact with a database in an object-oriented manner, 
where database tables are represented as classes, and rows in those tables are represented as objects.
This abstraction allows developers to work with databases using familiar object-oriented concepts, such as classes, 
objects, and inheritance, without needing to write complex SQL queries.

* Prisma Client, on the other hand, is the actual library that you use in your Node.js application to interact with your database

* Server Actions :-  Ability to call a function on server without setting up route is known as server
actions. Its same as Api but in case of hitting api we do need to define route
